## Description
The Wii SPii is an open source, portable Wii project by StonedEdge from the BitBuilt forums. It uses real Wii hardware with no emulation and lasts around 2.5 hours on a full charge. This repository includes includes code from several contributors to the hobby (Aurelio, Gmanmodz and Jefflongo), 
CAD files, gerbers for main PCB ordering and a BOM of parts for assembly. I plan to include a guide for assembly here at a later stage. The main build worklog can be found [here:](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/the-wii-spii.3347/)

### CAD
The CAD files for the Wii SPii project can be found here. I have uploaded both the .STEP and .STL files so that people may easily make changes to the model in their CAD software of choice, or simply print the case on any 3D printer. Prototypes were made on the Prusa i3 MK3s FDM printer and the final design was completed on a 3-axis CNC machine in acrylic. 

### PCB
The PCB is a 4 layer PCB ordered from JLCPCB fab house in china. The PCB can also be ordered from OSHPark or PCBway, however due to increased cost for 4-layer PCB from these fab houses, I would recommend ordering directly from JLCPCB for cheap PCBs and a quick turnaround time. A stencil is also required for ease of assembly along with solder paste and hot air to assemble the boards by hand. I made a 3D printable stencil jig that can be used for easy placement of the stencil and PCB that I have included [here:]()

### BOM (Bill of Materials) 
These are the required components you will need to build the Wii SPii. This includes the PCB itself, PCB components and other peripherals required to make the console. 

### Contributors 
I'd like to thank these people in no particular order for the awesome work you have done to help me complete this project. A link to their GitHub repositories can be found below. 

* Dmcke5 for helping me re-model the WiiSPii for CNC machining, CNC machining the case out of acrylic and of course the hours of phone calls back and forth over the past few months. Without you this project would not have happened!
* [Gman]() for providing the community with countless hours of research and sharing his code to allow me to make some small modifications to the LED interface and audio amplifier. 
* [Aurelio]() for GC+ 2.0 and BBloader 
* robertlong13 for assisting in the PIC16LF15324 modifications 
* [JeffLongo]() for his STUSB4500 code 
* YveltalGriffin
