## Description
The Wii SPii is an open source, portable Wii project by StonedEdge from the BitBuilt forums. It uses real Wii hardware with no emulation and lasts around 2.5 hours on a full charge. This repository includes includes code from several contributors to the hobby (Aurelio, Gmanmodz and Jefflongo), 
CAD files and gerbers for main PCB. I plan to include a guide for assembly here at a later stage. The main build worklog can be found [here:](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/the-wii-spii.3347/)

### CAD
The CAD files for the Wii SPii project can be found here. I have uploaded both the .STEP and .STL files so that people may easily make changes to the model in their CAD software of choice, or simply print the case on any 3D printer. Prototypes were made on the Prusa i3 MK3s FDM printer and the final design was completed on a 3-axis CNC machine in acrylic. 

### PCB
The PCB is a 4 layer PCB ordered from JLCPCB fab house in china. The PCB can also be ordered from OSHPark or PCBway, however due to increased cost for 4-layer PCB from these fab houses, I would recommend ordering directly from JLCPCB for cheap PCBs and a quick turnaround time. A stencil is also required for ease of assembly along with solder paste and hot air to assemble the boards by hand. I made a 3D printable stencil jig that can be used for easy placement of the stencil and PCB that I have included [here:]()

### BOM (Bill of Materials) 
These are the required components you will need to build the Wii SPii. This includes the PCB itself, PCB components and other peripherals required to make the console.
